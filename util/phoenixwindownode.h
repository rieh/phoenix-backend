/*
 * PhoenixWindowNode is a Node that wraps around an underlying PhoenixWindow. It fires heartbeat commands whenever the
 * window emits a QQuickWindow::frameSwapped() signal and will tell the underlying window whenever VSync mode changes.
 *
 * It handles creating and setting up a shared QOpenGLContext for the dynamic pipeline's use. Since the dynamic
 * pipeline and the scene graph's OpenGL context are created at different times, we must check that both are good to go
 * before sending any loads down the dynamic pipeline.
 *
 * Warning: The dynamic pipeline OpenGL context and the core must live in the same thread!
