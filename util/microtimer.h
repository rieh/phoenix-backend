/*
 * MicroTimer is an improved version of QTimer with potential microsecond accuracy and the ability to specify
 * the interval as a qreal. You also gain the ability to specify the frequency (which is how the interval's internally stored)
 * and to activate a max accuracy mode which further boosts the accuracy from microseconds to sub microseconds.
 *
 * Testing on Windows 10 and OS X 10.11 has shown this timer to be as accurate as +-0.1us on low system load. Your mileage may vary!
 * Note that max accuracy mode causes significant CPU usage. It's recommended to place MicroTimer in its own thread,
 * unless you have a thread in your program that offers a richer (larger/more frequent) set of events to work off of.
 * In that case, you'd be best off using that thread and leaving max accuracy mode off. Experiment to find out what works best!
 *
 * The Phoenix port of this class turns this into a Node. The emitting of heartbeat signals can be controlled by
 * sending Command::SetVsync to this node. In addition, the rate can be controlled by sending it Command::CoreFPS.
