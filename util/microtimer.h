// MicroTimer is an improved version of QTimer with potential microsecond accuracy and the ability to specify
// the interval as a qreal. You also gain the ability to specify the frequency (which is how the interval's internally stored)
// and to activate a max accuracy mode which further boosts the accuracy from microseconds to sub microseconds.
// Testing on Windows 10 and OS X 10.11 has shown this timer to be as accurate as +-0.1us on low system load. Your mileage may vary!
// Note that max accuracy mode causes significant CPU usage. It's recommended to place MicroTimer in its own thread,
// unless you have a thread in your program that offers a richer (larger/more frequent) set of events to work off of.
// In that case, you'd be best off using that thread and leaving max accuracy mode off. Experiment to find out what works best!
